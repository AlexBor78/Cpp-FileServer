## Idea && motivation

### Idea

I want to do something usfull on C++, that i will use to.

And I want to learn how work internet on low-level, how work with internet(and sockets) on my language.

I think create FileServer is the best idea for me.

### Motivation

I want to do first project what i will use,

I want to have xp and study some thmes.

And project is interesting and I didn't waste my summer.

## Architecture

My FileServer is open-source projects for linux(now),

It can use on one-pc or server-client/s.
I want to do it like other File-servers but made by me.

Why should I use this particular file server instead of others?

What protocol do the client and server communicate using?

Is my protocol based on tcp, more info in HowItWork.md.

How is the data transferred?

open, no protect now.

How can it be used?

download and build and use how you want

What are the restrictions?

All restrictions in cofig-file and harware.
